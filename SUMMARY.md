**MineralImage5k: A Benchmark for Zero-Shot Raw Mineral Visual Recognition and Description** is a dataset for object detection, semantic segmentation, and classification tasks. It is used in the geological research. 

The dataset consists of 19207 images with 31393 labeled objects belonging to 6 different classes including *stone*, *rock*, *mineral*, and other: *gem*, *crystal*, and *mineral ore*.

Images in the MineralImage5k dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 8 splits in the dataset: *1_syst* (15005 images), *7_stepanov* (1361 images), *5_PDK* (1057 images), *3_op* (745 images), *2_mest* (561 images), *4_cryst* (220 images), *10_meteor* (151 images), and *segm* (107 images). Additionally, the images have following tags: ***name***, description (***dsc***), ***size_sm***. The dataset was released in 2023 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Sber AI, Russia</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, Russia</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Fersman Mineralogical Museum, Russia</span>.
